## Root Cause Analysis

The missing transactions appear to fall into two categories:

1. **Page Boundary Issue**: The Buttercup transaction on 01/17 appears to be on a page boundary between pages 3 and 4 of the PDF.

2. **Date Range Issue**: All February transactions from 02/02 onwards are missing from the CSV, suggesting the extraction process may have stopped at 02/01 or there was an issue with processing the final page of transactions.

## Recommendations

1. **Review PDF Extraction Logic**: The extraction process needs to be checked for:
   - Proper handling of page boundaries
   - Complete extraction through the statement end date (02/07)
   - Special handling for different transaction types (Interest Payment, Online Transfer)

2. **Add Validation**: Implement checks to ensure:
   - Transaction count matches between PDF and CSV
   - Total debits/credits match the summary section
   - All dates within the statement period are represented

3. **Manual Verification**: The largest missing transaction is the $4,570.00 online transfer on 02/06, which significantly impacts the reconciliation.
