### Discover Card Statement Extraction ✅

Successfully extracted and processed all 2025 Discover Card statements (January - June):

#### Files Processed
- 6 monthly Discover statements (1342)
- 95 total transactions extracted
- 5 interest charges captured ($738.28 total)

#### Key Achievements

2. **Format Standardization**: Consistent CSV format with proper date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. **Clean Descriptions**: Removed category text, kept merchant names only
4. **Proper Amount Signs**: Purchases positive, payments negative
5. **Consolidated Reporting**: Created annual summary file

#### Output Files
- Monthly files: `extracted_data/2025/discover/monthly/`
- Consolidated file: `extracted_data/2025/discover/consolidated/2025 - Discover 1342.csv`

### Documentation Created ✅
